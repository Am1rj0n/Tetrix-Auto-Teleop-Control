# Tetrix-Auto-Teleop-Control
Remote control of a tetrix prizm robot using a ps4/ps5 controller. It features motor and servo control for driving, arm movement, and gripper operation. 

# Prizm PS4 Teleop Robot Control

This project allows you to control a TETRIX PRIZM-based robot using a PS4 controller. It supports motor movement, arm positioning, and gripper control via the controller buttons.

## Features

- Drive robot forward, backward, left, and right using D-pad
- Control robotic arm and gripper with PS4 buttons
- Simple autonomous setup sequence to initialize servo positions
- Uses PRIZM and TELEOP libraries for hardware interface

## Getting Started

1. Connect the PS4 controller to the PRIZM controller.
2. Upload the `control` code to your PRIZM controller.
3. Use the PS4 D-pad and buttons to control the robot.

## Controls

| PS4 Button  | Action              |
|-------------|---------------------|
| UP          | Move forward        |
| DOWN        | Move backward       |
| LEFT        | Turn left           |
| RIGHT       | Turn right          |
| CROSS       | Move arm down       |
| CIRCLE      | Move arm up         |
| SQUARE      | Open gripper        |
| TRIANGLE    | Close gripper       |

## Requirements

- TETRIX PRIZM controller  
- PS4/PS5 controller  
- PRIZM and TELEOP libraries
